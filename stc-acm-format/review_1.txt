Thank you for participating in STC-2. Some comments for improving your paper further:

- Please cite our overview paper as follows (you missed the BOOKTITLE):

@INPROCEEDINGS{shang17,
 AUTHOR = "Lifeng Shang and Tetsuya Sakai and Hang Li and Ryuichiro Higashinaka and Yusuke Miyao and Yuki Arase and Masako Nomoto",
 TITLE = "Overview of the {NTCIR}-13 Short Text Conversation Task",
 BOOKTITLE = "Proceedings of NTCIR-13",
 YEAR = {2017}
}

Also, include the BOOKTITLE for [1] as well.

- It would be nice to have rough English translations in Tables 1,3 (and Figures 3,5).

- Reference [7] is not a single author paper,
so should be Zaremba et al.

- Table 4 is unnecessary. This is the job of our overview paper.

- It would be good to conduct statistical significance tests to compare your own runs.

- It would be good to conduct a per-topic analysis - which runs perform well in which topics?


See you in Tokyo!
